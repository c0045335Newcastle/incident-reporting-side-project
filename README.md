# Basic Incident Reporting Side Project
### OVERVIEW
This is a simple project for an incident reporting system built using Node.js, Express and JWT for authentication functions built alongside web tutorials.
The project focuses on utilising basic authentication, authorisation and simple session management.

- User Registration and Authentication (hashes passwords)
- JWT tokens for securing API endpoints
- Basic incident reporting (stored in memory)
- JWT session management


### TECHNOLOGIES/SKILLS UTILISED
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing


### FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- Database integration: upgrade from memory to persistent storage methods
- User Roles: admin/basic user roles to allow for differing permissions
- Notifications: some form of alert sent to SMS/EMail about newly reported incidents
